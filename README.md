University project to create a web equivalent to YouTube Kids with safer and better organised content. 

My problems with YouTube Kids were 
1. that unsuitable videos were getting through the algorithms
2. the user could search for a video on something interesting and educational, and then the autoplay would show progressively simpler and simpler videos after that.

The result was an interface for moderating videos (fairly simple) and a playlist generator where users have a choice of equally valuable videos to watch.

The existing YouTube video suggestion feature would find the next video to play based on metadata on the first video, so for example the user searches for "sharks" and picks a documentary clip to start with. The next video YouTube autoplays will be found by searching for "sharks" and the most popular will be chosen by YouTube - this is likely to be "Baby Shark" or similar.

My project generated a playlist in the background related to the first video chosen and these were what was autoplayed after the initial video.
